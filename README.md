## QRN.Admin.DotNetCore
QRN.Admin.DotNetCore is a DotNetCore version for QRN.Admin Admin theme.

We always wanted a very lightweight admin template for our internal projects with the latest bootstrap. Previously we use some third party templates, but in those templates, there is always something missing, which made us sad, that's why we are trying to build **QRN.Admin** to serve all our purpose. 

This theme is ready for mobile and very lightweight (_at least that's what we are trying to do_ :)).
